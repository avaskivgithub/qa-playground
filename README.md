# qa-playground
A playground for playing around with testing using a "Test App".

"Test App" is the most simple test management tool, that consists of:
* sqlite as a backend with a single table Results that has (Id, Name, Description, Res, Error) fields
* REST api to do CRUD operations on the Results table records
* UI (if created) that uses api to add / edit / delete tests

## Purpose
Test App" is a playground for testing (to show what the process / tests can look like). This app can be used to:
* add new features (this way you'll try a programming language)
* add automated tests (note that those tests are not unit tests, but more of the system tests that perform black box testing)
* create test design / user stories / describe issues
* fix app itself or tests for that app
