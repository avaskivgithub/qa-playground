# Design Patterns
A playground for trying design patterns using:
- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by KevinZhang
- https://www.dofactory.com/net/design-patterns based on the book above


To be comfortable with UML diagrams use this article https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/503/design-patterns/uml-basics


## TBD
It would be cool to apply patterns to system tests.
